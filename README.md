# Vāṇi AI 🚀

**Vāṇi** is a next-generation, voice-activated AI assistant built to manage complex, real-world tasks from start to finish. Just say:  
_"Find a nearby dentist, book an appointment for tomorrow, and add it to my calendar."_  
Vāṇi takes care of the rest — completely hands-free.

## 🧠 What is Vāṇi?

Vāṇi is an AI-powered productivity assistant that understands natural voice commands and orchestrates multi-step workflows using intelligent agents. Whether it's booking appointments, managing calendars, or interacting with APIs, Vāṇi gets it done with minimal user input.

## 💡 Inspiration

The project stemmed from a shared vision between two collaborators:
- **[Your Full Name]** – Full-stack Developer, responsible for engineering and implementation.
- **[Friend's Full Name]** – Lead Researcher, responsible for market research and user flow design.

Together, we combined technical execution and UX-driven planning to build something impactful.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database & Auth:** Firebase  
- **Voice Processing & Multi-Agent AI:** [OmniDimension Platform](https://www.omnidim.io)  
- **APIs Integrated:** Google Maps, Calendar API, Appointment Booking APIs (dummy/demo for POC)

## 🎯 Features

- 🔊 **Voice-First Interaction:** Control the assistant through spoken commands.
- 🧠 **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Powered by OmniDimension’s intelligent agents for task execution.
- 📍 **Smart Location Awareness:** Find nearby services using geolocation and Google Maps API.
- 📆 **Calendar Integration:** Schedule events and appointments via voice.
- 🔐 **User Authentication:** Secure login and personalized session management using Firebase.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User gives a voice command (e.g., "Book me a dentist for tomorrow").
2. Vāṇi uses speech-to-text to process the input.
3. OmniDimension agents interpret the intent and break it into actionable steps.
4. APIs are called (e.g., Google Maps, Calendar).
5. The assistant responds via voice and confirms task completion.
